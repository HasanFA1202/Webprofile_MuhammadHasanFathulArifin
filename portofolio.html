My skills in design are still considered beginners and the tools I use are: Photoshop, Canva, Figma. I am currently taking part in the MSIB program at INFINITE LEARNING partners and the program I am taking is web development with the aim of improving my skills in programming, especially in front end and I want to increase my skills in UI UX Design</p>
